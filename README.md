# Template repository for creating new xsh libraries

This GitHub [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) can be used to create a new repository with the skeleton of the xsh library.

Start here: https://github.com/xsh-lib/template/generate

Once created, your new repository will execute a GitHub Actions workflow that uses cookiecutter to rewrite the repository to the desired state. This make take 30 seconds or so.
